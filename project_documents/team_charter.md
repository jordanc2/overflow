### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**

about our strengths and weaknesses. Help each other with any areas of improvement.

    Communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward
    until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity,
    give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if
    necessary, escalate to our instructor.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

     Having a clear understanding of what is needed from you as a team member, break down larger tasks into smaller
     more manageable ones.

     Speak up early when you run into a roadblock. Be honest about what task held you back.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**

     be completed and clear deadlines.
