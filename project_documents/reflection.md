# [Team Overflow] Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?
<br>
<br>
We followed the UML Sequence and Class Designs very closely in the design document. After implementation, we needed to
go back and back changes to some endpoints in our API design.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  <br>
  <br>
We took our time planning the MVP, class and sequence designs for our backend.
  <br>
  <br>
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
  <br>
  <br>
Peer coding and bringing blockers to the team to work together helped keep us on track.
  <br>
  <br>
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  <br>
  <br>
Yes, bringing blockers up to other team members in a timely manner and being honest with our abilities helped
keep the team focused and on track. Prioritizing tasks based on teammates strengths and weaknesses also helped
give us a steady workflow.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
  <br>
  <br>
With daily standups we had clear communication and understanding of what tasks were needed to complete a sprint.
Next time, we would like to have more icebreakers to make it more fun.
  <br>
  <br>
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  <br>
  <br>
There was an overestimation of how long it would take to implement new technologies we are
utilising in the code base(HTML, CSS, React, Cognito)

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
  <br>
  <br>
We would try to have a better understanding of AWS authentication and deployment technologies, Cognito and Amplify,
so we could better utilize them in the future.
